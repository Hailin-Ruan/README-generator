  ## Description
  The README.md Generator is a command-line application designed to streamline the process of creating professional and comprehensive README files for your software projects. Instead of manually crafting a README from scratch, this user-friendly tool prompts you with a series of questions about your project. Your responses are then used to automatically generate a high-quality README.md file with consistent formatting and essential sections such as project description, installation instructions, usage guidelines, contribution details, testing procedures, licensing information, and contact details.
